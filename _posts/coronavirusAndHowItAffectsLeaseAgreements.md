# Coronavirus and Its Effects on Lease Agreements

### Adaptation of Lease Agreements in the Framework of Excessive Difficulty in Performance Due to Coronavirus and The Verdict of The Bursa Regional Court of Appeal

###### January 01, 2021 - 20 min read

**Keywords:** Excessive difficulty in performance, lease amount, lease agreement, adaptation demand, exception of pacta sunt servanda, interim measure, good faith, evacuation of the leased property, collapse of the underlying basis of the transaction, COVID-19, Coronavirus, Turkish Code of Obligations Article 138

The parties are bound by the agreement they made as a rule within the scope of the “Pacta Sunt Servanda" principle. However, the strict implementation of this principle may cause unfair results in some cases, therefore, some exceptions have been stipulated in the law. One of the exceptions to this rule is the theory of the collapse of the underlying basis of the transaction (geschäftsgrundlage). Sometimes the changes that occur in the conditions seriously disrupt the balance between the performances against the obligor. Even though the debt is not impossible and the performance is still possible, this performance becomes very difficult to complete and unbearable for the Obligor. In this case, the Obligor shall be entitled to demand from the judge the adaptation of the contract to new circumstances, or to rescind the contract where such adaptation is not possible, or finally to terminate the contract. The basis of the request for adaptation under the heading "Excessive Difficulty in Performance" in Article 138 of the Turkish Code of Obligations numbered 6098 is the good faith principle stipulated in Article 2 of the Turkish Civil Code numbered 4721. It should be stated that the adaptation in this context is possible in the presence of very rare and stringent conditions, such as follows:

1. After the conclusion of the contract, an extraordinary situation that was not foreseen or expected by the parties must occur,
2. This situation must not be caused by the Obligor,
3. This situation must change the facts present at the time of conclusion of the contract against the Obligor’s side in such a way that demanding performance from the Obligor would violate the principle of good faith and
4. The Obligor must not have performed his/her debt or must have performed his/her debt by reserving the rights of excessive difficulty.

If all of the above conditions are met, the Obligor is able to demand an adaptation of the contract from the judge in accordance with the changed circumstances. If the adaptation is not possible, the Obligor has the right to terminate the contract.

Undoubtedly, the COVID-19 epidemic surrounding the world and our country can be stated as an extraordinary situation as mentioned above. Since such an epidemic cannot be foreseen by the parties, this situation is not caused by the obligor and the balance between the performances has changed against the obligor’s side in such a way that demanding performance from the Obligor would violate the principle of good faith.

Bursa Regional Court of Appeal made critical evaluations on this matter in the precedent decision numbered 2020/1103 E. and 2020/1008 K. Accordingly, the COVID-19 epidemic period must be considered as an extraordinary situation. However, it is not possible to apply the provision to all lease agreements. The court shall evaluate the effects of the epidemic and the measures taken on the Obligor and shall adapt the contract according to the new condition to distribute the burden on both parties of the contract (by taking into account that this extraordinary situation was not caused by the Lessor) in every concrete case where the adaptation of the lease amount is demanded. In addition, the adaptation shall only be made to cover this extraordinary period and the lease amount shall be reinstated when the effects of the epidemic completely disappear and the Obligor’s business situation returns to normal before the epidemic.

On the other hand, it is crucial to state that the Obligor is also able to request an interim measure in the process of adaptation. However, no decision shall be made in a way that resolves the merits of the case and the dispute. In order to determine whether the conditions of interim measures have occurred, first of all the legal nature of the case of adaptation should be examined in every concrete case. However, considering these epidemic and market conditions, it is clear that the Obligor will not be able to pay the current rent. Undoubtedly, if the Lessor demand the evacuation of the leased property by default of the Obligor, this situation will cause irreparable damages. Instead of this negative result, when the Court gives the interim measure and then decides that there are no adaptation conditions at the end of the lawsuit or that the lease amount must be reduced to a lower, the remaining amount will be demanded by the Lessor and there will be no irreparable damage. In addition, the interim measure is also for a temporary period, and this shall only be applied during the effects of the epidemic. As stated in the article 396/1 of Code of Civil Procedure numbered 6100, when these conditions disappear, the injunction should be changed or removed.
