**Definite Term:** In the surety relationship, the surety takes a personal guarantee against the risk of the obligor who is not performing his/her debt without taking counter performance and is responsible for this during the period of the actual debt relationship. The duration of the debt relationship constitutes only an upper limit in terms of the surety’s liability. 

Pursuant to Article 600 of the TCO, the liability of the surety arising from the surety agreement will be automatically terminated upon the expiry of the term (the additional one-month period in the obsolete Code of Obligations has been repealed in the new Law numbered 6098). The effect of the period is absolute, the surety will automatically terminate as required by law, without any notification or notice of the surety, and the agreements made by the parties in the opposite direction will be null and void. The beginning of the period, as a rule, is the moment of establishment of the surety agreement. Applying to the surety within the specified period will prevent the effect of the period terminating the surety. Definite term surety agreement can be made in terms of both ordinary and joint surety. In cases, which the surety period is determined on the basis of the due of the principal debt, the due of the principal debt must be specific or determinable in order to be able to state a definite term surety. Otherwise, there will be no definite term surety. It is possible for the parties to make an agreement regarding to determine the surety period after the establishment of the agreement. Since it increases the liability of the surety, agreements regarding the determination of the duration or the extension of the predetermined period after the established surety agreement will be in the same form of a surety agreement in accordance with the provisions of Article 582/III of the TCO. 

In the application of the Court of Cassation, in case of surety for the lease agreement, it is accepted that the surety will also expire at the end of the period specified in the lease agreement if there is no clear determination as to whether the surety will continue for the extended periods of the lease agreement. The Court of Cassation accepts the surety contract as a definite term surety depending on the duration of the lease agreement for a protective purpose. Accordingly, the liability period of the surety is limited to the lease agreement, and the surety cannot be held responsible for the receivables for the extended periods in which the lease agreement spontaneously extends, and the receivables that may be requested within this framework will not be within the scope of the surety. 

**Indefinite Term:** If the period for which the surety will be liable in the contract is not determined explicitly or implicitly, an indefinite term surety relationship comes up. In this case, in order to ensure that the obligor is followed immediately by the obligee, Article 601 of the TCO has been issued. Accordingly, the liability of the surety will end as required by law if certain conditions in the provision are met. With the precondition that the principal debt is due, the surety is able to request from the obligee to exercise his rights of lawsuit and follow-up against the obligor, to request foreclosure (if any), and to continue these proceedings without interruption within a one-month period. If these duties are not fulfilled by the obligee, the surety will be automatically terminated as required by law. The surety will be able to benefit from this opportunity at any time in the case of ordinary surety and in the cases stipulated by law in the joint surety. 
If the debt will be due on condition that the notification to be made by the obligee, the surety may request from the obligee to make a notice, but this request must be made at the end of one year at the earliest after the establishment of the surety agreement. In cases where the obligee can make a notice of due at a date exceeding one year after the establishment of the surety contract, the obligee may be requested to make a notification at this future date. After making the notification, the obligee has to fulfill the mentioned duties. Otherwise, the surety will end again. It is possible to shorten the time. In cases where the surety can be applied directly, the relevant provision will not be applied. 

**Ten-Year Upper Limit:** One of the most important provisions protecting the surety is the maximum time limitation stipulated in terms of natural persons in Article 598/III of the TCO. The field of application of the provision is natural persons, and legal persons cannot benefit from this protection. According to the provision to be applied in terms of both ordinary and joint surety, real people are allowed to commit surety for a maximum of ten years. Even if the parties have agreed for a longer period of guarantee, the liability of real people will expire at the end of the ten-year upper period, unless an extended or a new surety has been issued. The period starts with the establishment of the surety agreement. A real person who guarantees future debt will be relieved of responsibility even if the debt has not yet arisen at the end of ten years. Here, the risk of losing the collateral is on the obligee. If a contrary arrangement is made in the contract, the exceeding of the time limit will be null and void. If the ten-year period expired before the TCO entered into force, but the surety contract is still in progress in terms of the surety agreements made on the time of the obsolete Law, an additional period of one year will be applied, which will be calculated from the effective date of the TCO, and the surety will expire after this one year. It is taken into consideration ex officio by the judge that the surety ends after the ten-year period. 

Exceptions are mentioned in the rest of the provision. Accordingly, the surety and the obligee are able to extend their suretyship by establishing a new surety agreement, but the new contract will also be subject to a ten-year time limit also. The other exception is the situation where, if the parties agree, they can extend the liability of the guarantor for another ten years, once only, under certain conditions in the provision. The extension of the liability will only be possible with a written statement of the surety in accordance with the form of the surety agreement, one year before the end of the bail at the earliest. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the extension agreement will become effective from the end of the bail period. The extension of the liability will only be possible with a written statement in accordance with the same form of the surety agreement, one year before the end of the suretyship at the earliest. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the extension agreement will become effective from the end of the surety period. 

Surety debt, which becomes due within its period, is independent of the period of limitations of the principal debt and is subject to the ten-year general period of limitations under article 146 of the TCO. This period starts with the due date of the surety’s debt and the earliest on the day the principal debt is due. Because the surety depends on the principal debt, the debt of the surety cannot be due before the principal debt. The general ten-year limitation period will no longer be applied if the current surety debt is under a definite term surety agreement for less than ten years.

Pursuant to Article 155 of the TCO, when the period of limitations is cut against the obligor, it will also be cut against the surety but when it is issued against the surety, it will not be imposed against the obligor. If the surety has become a surety without knowing that the original debt has expired, he/she will be able to set the period of limitations against the obligee. It does not matter whether the obligor has given up on the period of limitations defense. However, if the surety has become a surety knowing that the actual debt has expired, he/she cannot put forward the period of limitations defense.
