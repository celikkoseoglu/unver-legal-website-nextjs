# Pledge Establishment on Joint Stock Company Shares

### Nature and Establishment of Pledge Rights Established on Joint Stock Company Shares

###### October 01, 2021 - 25 min read

###### Keywords: pledge of joint stock company shares, registered share, promissory share, bearer share, pledge agreement, blank endorsement, surrender of possession, pledged creditor, converted into money 

Share refers to a certain number of divided parts of the principal capital. All the rights granted by the joint stock company can be used independently of the whole, by courtesy of these shares. Due to their material value and transferable nature, these shares are subject to collateral transactions and a pledge is often established on these shares.

The pledge established on a joint stock company share, which is essentially a type of movable pledge, is a pledge of rights and receivables in nature, in this respect articles 954-961 of Turkish Civil Code are applied. However, since the pledge of the joint stock company's share concerns commercial law, the commercial law legislation should also be taken into account. In the share pledge, the pledge agreement, which is a debiting transaction, is not dependent on any form. However, the act of disposal required for the establishment of the pledge is a subject to different legal regulations depending on whether the pledged share is bound to the promissory note, and if it is bound to the promissory note, depending on the type of the bill. However, whether the share is bonded or not, the right of pledge is established on the shareholder rights unless there is a contrary arrangement. The provisions of pledge on delivery will be applied. On the other hand, the establishment of a pledge on the share will not lead to a change in the title of shareholder, unlike the transfer of the share; The pledged creditor will only be able to collect the pledged receivable from the amount obtained by converting the pledged share into money, in case the secured receivable is not paid. It should also be noted that since the share pledge does not refer to the goods, it will not provide limited real rights; the right of the pledged creditor shall take priority over other creditors. 
It should be noted that not all rights arising from the share will fall within the scope of the pledge. The scope of the pledge includes only the rights related to the assets that can be converted into money. Therefore, the rights to participate in the management, such as the right to participate in the general assembly and vote, which cannot be converted into cash, will not constitute the subject of the pledge.

The amount and legal reason for the receivable to be secured by pledge do not have to be specified in the pledge agreement. Because if the amount of the receivable can be determined based on the conversion of the pledge into money, this will be sufficient. The pledge agreement for the uncertified securities will be a contract that imposes a debt on one party; in certified securities (shares), it will be a contract that imposes debts on both parties. In this case, the pledger undertakes to transfer the possession of the share attached to the promissory note to the creditor; The creditor will also be obliged to return the share certificates provided that the pledged receivable expires.
When the pledger pledges more than one share for the same receivable, there will be a collective pledge institution and each share will be responsible for the entire receivable. Company shares cannot be collectively pledged without any specification, even if they are dematerialized.

If the joint stock company share is not documented in any note, a pledge will be established on the bare share. In this case, it is sufficient to make a written pledge agreement pursuant to Article 955/1 of the Turkish Civil Code. Written form is a condition of validity, and with the conclusion of this contract, a pledge is established on the company's share without the need for any further action. Notification of the pledge to the company prevents the company from paying in good faith its assets such as dividends and liquidation shares to the pledger. On the other hand, since the rule of "no one can transfer more than his right" is valid for the receivables that are not documented to the negotiable instruments, if the pledger does not have the power of disposal, the creditor cannot gain the right of pledge even if he has good faith.
It is possible for the shares to be registered by the Central Registry Agency (CRA) and for legal transactions to be made over the dematerialized value. In order to establish the right of pledge on the dematerialized shares, a written pledge agreement must be made. Because in this possibility, the dematerialized share in question is actually a bare share. The notification made to CRA will have an explanatory effect, and the right of pledge will be established with the conclusion of a written pledge agreement between the pledger and the creditor. The notification made to CRA is valid in terms of asserting the right of pledge against third parties. Here, it will be made public that the right of pledge is established by third parties and these persons will not be able to claim good faith.

The share can be documented to a bearer or registered certificate to facilitate circulation. In this context, if bearer share certificates are issued, the right of pledge is established with the delivery of the note to the creditor. What is meant by "delivery" here is the transfer of the possession of the bearer note to the creditor in accordance with the principles of pledge on movables subject to delivery. This transfer has a founding effect since the provision of Article 939/1 of the Turkish Civil Code; “which stipulates the transfer is mandatory”, the parties cannot decide otherwise. In order for the right of pledge to be considered established, a real contract is required. What is meant by the real contract is the agreement of will, which is sought at the time of the transfer of possession and which is often implicit. Accordingly, the parties must have agreed that the possession is transferred for the purpose of pledge. If the shareholder has acted for another purpose, the right of pledge is not established even if the creditor takes over the possession of the notes. It is not necessary to make a pledge agreement written in the pledge of the bearer share certificate. Nevertheless, there is no need for the pledge right to be recorded in the company's share book or to be notified to the company. 

Yet, making the notice prevents the company from performing a good faith act upon the pledger. In this case, the pledged creditor is protected. Because, the pledger can save only by transfer of possession, and the pledge creditor can claim the right of pledge against third parties, regardless of good faith. The point to be noted here is that the exclusive sovereignty of the pledger over the share must end. If this sovereignty does not end, the right of pledge does not arise. Therefore, the right of pledge cannot be established by forfeiting delivery or joint possession on the promissory note. Good faith is preserved in bearer promissory notes. Because of that, if the creditor does not know or is not able to know that the pledger does not have the power of disposition, he acquires the right of pledge on the condition that it depends on the basic relationship.
Since the registered share certificates of joint stock companies are in the nature of promissory notes by law, their pledge is subject to the provision of Article 956/2 of the Turkish Civil Code. 

Therefore, provisions of negotiable instruments are applied. Transfer of registered shares is possible in two ways:

- Turnover and transfer of possession,
- Written declaration of transfer and transfer of possession

If the share is to be pledged by endorsement, the pledge endorsement must be made. If the right of pledge is established with a blank endorsement, the burden of proving that it is a pledge endorsement, rests with the claiming party. Here, the statement written on the promissory note is endorsement. Written declaration of transfer, which is written on a separate paper is the same nature as the written pledge agreement. The point to be noted here is that no matter which way is chosen, the transfer of possession to the creditor is mandatory for the establishment of the pledge. The pledger must have the power of disposition otherwise the right of pledge does not arise. However, if the registered share is pledged by endorsement, the creditor will only win the pledge in good faith in this way, and if the above-mentioned second way is used, he will not win the pledge right.

If the post pledge is established, the previous creditor must be notified in writing that the post pledge has been established. It doesn't matter whether the previous pledged creditor consents to it or not, but this notice has a founding effect for the establishment of the post-pledge.
Eventually, it should be noted that the provisions regarding the transfer of receivables will also be applied to the share pledge by analogy. In addition, if the right of pledge arises directly from the law, there will be no need for debiting transactions or act of disposal.
