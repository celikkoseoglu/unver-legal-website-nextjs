# Legal Reason in Upper Limit Mortgage and Guaranty Agreements of Banks Restricting the Economic Freedom of Consumers

### The necessity of the legal reason in the mortgage agreement and the validity of the phrase "guarantee for all debts born and to be born" imposed by banks in these agreements

**Precedent:** the 23rd Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation, decision numbered E. 2016/7779 K., 2020/1252, dated 24/February/2020 

According to the Turkish Civil Code, any receivables that have not yet arisen, but are considered certain or possible to arise, can be secured with a mortgage. This type of mortgage is called an “upper limit mortgage”. Even though the principle of supervenience has weakened in the establishment phase of the mortgage here, the purpose of the legislator to make this mortgage possible in the form of a mortgage is to allocate a rank in favor of the mortgage in the future, subject to the condition that the receivable is established validly. 

In practice, it is seen that banks have expanded the scope of mortgage collaterals in an unpredictable manner by using the expression “guarantee for all debts born and to be born” in the upper limit mortgage contracts they make, as a collateral for certain loans, and conclude agreements containing provisions that abolish the boundaries of the loan relationship that can be reasonably expected.

It is a controversial issue whether the basic loan relationship to be secured with a mortgage should be included in the contract as the legal reason of the mortgage. One opinion argues that it is adequate to state the amount of the secured receivables, and that there is no need to include an excerpt legal reasoning. Another view argues that a legal reason should be included in the agreement. The third view argues that it is sufficient to specify only the amount of receivable in the principal mortgage and it is not necessary to specify the legal reason, yet it is necessary to specify the legal reason in the upper limit mortgage to constitute for the unborn receivables. As Unver Legal, we agree with the third opinion, since it is the best in terms of legal security.

Indeed, if the legal reason is not shown in the "Upper Limit Mortgage”, all kinds of receivables of the creditor against the debtor are included in the scope of the mortgage and the mortgage liability carries a life-long risk that is impossible to terminate, limiting the economic freedom of the debtor to an immoral degree. Therefore, this restriction raises a violation of individual freedoms within the scope of the Turkish Civil Code Article 23. In addition, an indefinite collateral debt, as we come across in a decision of the Court of Cassation, carries the risk of causing harmful consequences in terms of obtaining the receivables of third parties and exercising their rights, or in terms of commercial life, since this situation even damages the principle of trust in the title deed. The incident subject to the decision is related to prevention of the collection of the receivable due to the wrong arrangement of the execution chart of the plaintiff's receivables because of the inclusion of “all debts born and to be born” in favor of the defendant bank. The Court of First Instance rejected the complaint request, and upon the appeal of the decision of the Complaint, the 23rd Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation decided that other loans used by the debtor from the bank other than housing finance, and loans arising from the credit card, could not be counted within the scope of the mortgage and reversed the decision of the First Instance Court.

In addition, it is useful to mention the General Transaction Terms, which is an element that restricts the freedom of contract. Under similar conditions, banks take advantage of the difficult situation of the weak debtor and the debtor has no option other than accepting the terms of this contract for the loan to be used. However, pursuant to the Turkish Code of Obligations Article 25, it is necessary to acknowledge that the terms in the contract that are against the debtor or aggravating the debtor’s condition contrary to the rules of honesty, are invalid by being subject to a content audit. 

As a result, the legal reason should be specified in the guarantee agreement for the upper limit mortgage, and debts that exceed the reasonable limits of the legal reason should not be included in the scope of the mortgage. In addition, dangerous expressions such as “all debts born and to be born” that are able to limit the economic freedom of the collateral debtor and confine the debtor to a lifetime collateral relationship, should not be binding.
