The main purpose of the principle of law, which is expressed as “The Theory of Lifting the Corporate Veil”, is to prevent the legal entity from being used as a tool to get rid of any liability that may arise from law, contract, or any other source. With this theory, it is possible to follow to company partners who want to take advantage of the limited liability principle, or another company established to get rid of debt. In this context, in cases where the principle of separation of legal entities is abused, the legal entity element is not taken into account, in other words, real obliged parties who make a different legal entity defense in order to avoid legal responsibility can be held responsible for the debt. However, in accordance with the principle of “narrow interpretation of exceptions”, the theory of lifting the corporate veil should only be applied in certain and limited situations, considering the statement of the Court of Cassation that "it should be applied with caution". 

The legal basis of the theory in Swiss law is the “good faith”. With an evaluation to be made within the framework of the abuse of right and circumvention criteria, it will be checked whether the legal entity of the company is used contrary to its legal purpose and function. In this context, if the sole shareholder tries to evade the creditor by transferring his/her personal assets to the company and transferring his/her shares in the company to third party, the creditor is able to seize the company assets for the debt of the shareholder. Although the subject is controversial in German law, if the legal entity structure is used illegally or if it is against the good faith to rely on the distinction between the company and the partners, this institution is going to be applied. In French law, the concept of "abuse of legal personality" was propounded. In this context, the legal entity cannot serve the purpose of concealing the activities carried out. Therefore, it can be concluded that the "fictitious company", which only apparently exists, does not have a legal existence, and the measures that can be applied by the court for a company in insolvency can also be applied to managers even if they are not a merchant. In American law, the purpose of the institution is expressed as “preventing deceptive behavior and ensuring fairness”. In this context, if it is understood that the legal entity is used to avoid personal liability, the court may turn to the partner of the company, who hides behind the company structure. 

In Turkish legislation, there are legal regulations that reflect the responsibilities of the legal person to its members or managers, depending on the understanding of lifting the corporate veil. For example, in accordance with the Law No. 6183, the liability of the partners in limited companies due to public debts is in this aspect. As another example, bank managers and supervisors, who cause the bank's operating license to be revoked or the management and supervision of the bank to be transferred to the SDIF, are personally and limitedly liable for the damages they cause to the bank. In this context, in accordance with Article 134 of Law No. 5411, SDIF may apply to the responsibility of all real and legal persons who are in the same economic integrity as the bank, to collect the receivables of the bank. 

The phenomenon of different legal entities should not be considered only formally. The purpose of this is to decide on a possible dispute, it should be considered the economic and commercial dimensions between the parties, the rule of good faith and the criteria of equity. Even though there are different legal entities, if there is an economic identity and if the principle of separation of the legal entity is clearly abused, the theory of lifting the corporate veil can be applied pursuant to “honesty rule” of the Turkish Civil Code article 2. 

It is also possible to lift the corporate veil between sister companies within the same group of companies. The most important point to be considered in this institution, which is expressed as "lifting the veil crosswise" in the doctrine is whether the sister companies are independent enterprises in economic terms. If there is no economic unity between the sister companies, the theory of lifting the corporate veil cannot be applied. For example, in businesses that engage in different commercial and economic activities such as food, automotive and energy in the subsidiary business community. On the other hand, if the production, marketing and export activities of the subsidiary companies are complementary to each other, they essentially form one and the same economic enterprise. Therefore, there would be economic identity justifying the lifting the veil crosswise between the sister companies. 

Concrete applications of the theory of lifting the veil:
	1) Lack of own resources:
	2) Mixing of assets,
	3) Foreign management

Lack of equity is an economic concept, not a legal one. Accordingly, if the equity owned by the company is very low compared to the risk it carries due to the nature of the commercial activity it carries out, it may be possible to lift the veil. The Court of Cassation refers to this issue as "an effort to impose debts on a formally different legal entity that is unable to pay". 

Mixing of assets refers to situations where it is not possible to distinguish between the parent company or the subsidiary company. If the accounting has not been kept sufficiently transparent or for any reason it has become impossible to control whether the capital is maintained, responsibility can be established by removing the veil. However, in some cases, even company officials and personnel may be the same between the parent company and the subsidiary company. In such cases, the difference between legal entities cannot be understood from the point of view of the counter-other party, and even if it is thought that a transaction is made with a single company, it can be concluded that the veil can be lifted in accordance with the theory of trust.

Foreign management criteria is the personal responsibility of the controlling partner as a result of the activities carried out in line with the private interest of the controlling partner of the company. 

The institution in question finds a place for itself in practice and is described in the case-laws of the Council of State as "taking the factual situation as a basis, not the abstract legal situation", and it is frequently seen in the decisions of the Court of Cassation. In a decision on the subject, the Court of Cassation ruled that the transfer of shares of the two defendant companies, a few months after the issue of the invoice, whose partners and directors are the same persons,   a collusive transfer made for the purpose of getting rid of the debt. According to the Court, the transfer is a movement that tries to hide the economic identity. For this reason, the legal entity defense made by the other defendant company was considered as an abuse of right and the legal entity veil was lifted and the company that made the relevant defense was held responsible. In a decision of the Istanbul Regional Court of Appeal in 2019, the court accepted lifting the corporate veil by stating the newly established company partially or completely took over all the assets of the main debtor company and left only debt to the main debtor company, the newly established company has an economic integrity both in terms of management and assets beyond the organic bond, all the elements of the principle of identity have been realized, and it cannot be said that the newly established company has good intentions. The Court justified the verdict that the newly established defendant company was established and started to operate in the same business center ten days after the plaintiff bank sent a notice to the other defendant main debtor company, uses a similar title to create confusion with the debtor company, operates in the same sector as the debtor company, some immovables belonging to the debtor company and the brand of the debtor company took over, the factory and machinery belonging to the debtor company were rented for a long time, the managers of the company and the new company were the same people, and the newly established company is understood the continuation of the main debtor company in the commercial press.
