The concept of "company" in Turkish law, in a narrow sense, refers to two types of company structures, as follows: "ordinary companies" without legal personality and "commercial companies" with legal personality. Although there is no general company definition in our laws, it can be said that the definition of "ordinary company" in article 620 of the Turkish Code of Obligations No. 6098 is accepted as a general definition. The law defines an ordinary company (hereinafter referred to as an ordinary partnership) mainly as a type of contract. According to this, an ordinary partnership is a contract in which two or more persons undertake to join their efforts and/or goods to reach a common goal, which ultimately is to generate a profit. According to the second paragraph of the same article, if a partnership does not have the distinctive features of partnerships regulated by law, it will be considered an ordinary partnership. In the meantime, due to the convenience in the establishment of an ordinary partnership or the fact that the ordinary partnership is not taxpayer for income and corporate income, people often choose the way of establishing an ordinary partnership in commercial life.

However, like every other contract, the ordinary partnership contract will also expire. The termination of an ordinary partnership is an economic activity rather than a legal activity since it essentially means a “capitalization". Therefore, it is very important for commercial life to make the termination process duly and correctly. The Court of Cassation describes the liquidation process as a "purification" process. What is meant by this is to examine the accounts and transactions related to the liquidation and partnership, and to reveal the assets and liabilities of the partnership by preparing a balance sheet. The termination of an ordinary partnership is in two groups as spontaneous termination (dissolution) and rescission and is regulated in the provisions of Article 639-640 of the TCO. 

######Spontaneous Termination Reasons: 
1. Achievement of the goal stipulated in the partnership agreement, or the goal of the partnership becoming impossible to achieve: What is meant here is objective impossibility, and that the goal in question cannot be achieved by anyone. However, it is also within this scope if the partners come to an agreement to such an extent that they cannot achieve the aforementioned goal. On the other hand, the partners can change the purpose and continue the partnership by changing the ordinary partnership agreement. This requires a unanimous decision.

2. Death of a partner: If there is no prior agreement has been reached with the descendants of the partner for continuation of the partnership.

3. If there is no provision in the contract regarding the continuation of the partnership, enforced execution of the liquidation share of the partner, bankruptcy of the partner or restriction of the partner: In these cases, it is possible to continue the partnership by removing the mentioned partner. In this context, in accordance with Article 624/1 of the TCO, the remaining partners must take a unanimous decision. However, pursuant to Article 633 of the TCO, in such a case, the aforementioned partner may leave the partnership on his own will, if there is a provision in the ordinary partnership agreement in this regard.

4. Expiry of the term determined in the partnership agreement: If the partnership activity continues despite the expiry of the term, the partnership turns into an indefinite partnership.

5. Acquisition

######Rescission Reasons:
1. By unanimous decision of all partners,

2. With a Partner's Notice of Termination: such right is given to such partner in the partnership agreement, or the partnership is formed for an indefinite period of time, or it is decided in the partnership agreement that the partnership shall cease with the death of a partner. Termination can be affected by giving a notice six months in advance within the scope of good faith.

3. Court Decision: In the presence of a just cause, each of the partners can always request the termination of the partnership from the court, regardless of the notice period. The existence of a just cause is appreciated by the court.

######Liquidation

The dissolution of the partnership and the liquidation of the partnership are separate legal proceedings. In other words, the termination of the ordinary partnership will not legally eliminate the partnership, it will start the liquidation period. As a rule, the powers of representation and management end. At this stage, the existing transactions regarding the partnership are completed, but new transactions are not started. However, the termination will not change the obligations of the partners towards third parties. 

Liquidation is the termination of the partnership by determining all the assets of the partnership, the termination of the partnership by cutting all other relations arising from the partnership, sharing the goods, or selling them. As a rule, liquidation will be carried out jointly by all partners. However, by stipulating otherwise in the contract or by taking the decision of the partners, the task of carrying out the liquidation may be left to one or more partners or the liquidator. If the partners cannot agree on the appointment of a liquidator, they can apply to the court and request the appointment of a liquidator (liquidation officer). 

The fee to be paid to the liquidator is determined by the judge, considering the labor required by the liquidation and the income of the partnership assets, unless there is a provision in the contract regarding this matter or a unanimous decision by the partners. 

According to the practice of the Court of Cassation, the task to be done by the court is, in accordance with the above-mentioned provisions, to first check whether there is a provision in this regard in the partnership agreement, and if there is, to ensure that the liquidation is carried out according to this provision; If there is no provision, asking the partners to determine a liquidator by agreement; In the event that an agreement cannot be reached on this issue, it will be to appoint one or three experts in the field of activity of the partnership as liquidator.

Thereupon, the liquidation process will be carried out by the liquidator in three stages, in quarterly periods stipulated by the judge:

1. In the first stage, all assets of the partnership (active + passive) will be determined as of the date the partnership is terminated, an account statement showing the partnership account will be requested from the managing partner. If there is an objection in this matter, they will be evaluated together with other evidence to be collected. 

2. In the second stage, the sale and cashing of the assets of the partnership will be carried out, and if these goods are not available, their values will be determined by an expert. 

3. In the third stage, the debts of the partnership will be paid first from the value determined after the above transactions and the advances given by each of them to the partnership, the expenses made for the partnership and the participation shares will be returned to the partners. If anything remains after that, a balance sheet will be prepared to distribute the remaining gain or loss to the partners.

If the remaining assets of the partnership after the debts, expenses and advances are paid are not sufficient to return the participation shares of the partners, the loss will be shared among the partners (TCO article 643/2). If a partner has put the ownership of something as a share of participation, because of the liquidation to be made upon the termination of the partnership, he cannot get that thing back as it is; however, he can demand whatever value was determined for his/her contribution share (TCO article 642). It should be noted that while determining the value, the date closest to the verdict will be taken as a basis, not the date of filing the lawsuit. 

After the final stage, according to the final balance sheet of the liquidator, the judge will determine the rights and obligations of the parties, terminate the liquidation process, and make a judgment.

The last point that we would like to remind you is that the claims arising from the ordinary partnership agreement are subject to a 5 (five) year statute of limitations. However, the statute of limitations will not begin until the ordinary partnership is fully liquidated in accordance with the procedure and law.
