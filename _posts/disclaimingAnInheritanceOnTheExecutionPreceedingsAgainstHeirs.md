Disclaiming an inheritance, regulated in the Turkish Civil Code, is a way that allows the heir to not accept the title of inheritance. This way is possible either by the heir's own will (real denial) or as regulated by law, with the presumption that the heirs will be deemed to have rejected the inheritance in the presence of certain conditions (denial by default).

The period of denial by the heir's own will is three months. This three-month period is a period of prescription; therefore, it is not possible to stop or interrupt the period.

According to the verdict of the Plenary Assembly of the Court of Cassation dated 19th November 2014 and numbered 2013 / 12-2240 E, 2014/929 K., the claim regarding not being liable for the debt due to the denial of the inheritance is an objection to the debt and the objection must be made upon the notification of the payment order. However, this principle applies where the court decision regarding the denial of inheritance is taken on a date before the execution proceedings are finalized.

On the other hand, if the verdict regarding the denial of the inheritance is taken after the finalization of the execution proceeding, the debtor's request cannot be considered as an objection to the debt. In this context, as stated in the verdict of the 12th Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation numbered 2019/11002 E, 2020/6831 K., since the request is made in the post-objection period, there will be no objection to the debt, but in this case, even if the execution proceedings made against the heirs is finalized, the document received regarding denial of the inheritance will remove attachments.

If the debtor dies after the execution proceedings against him/her, the creditor must request the continuation of the proceedings against the heritage or the heirs in accordance with the Execution and Bankruptcy Law. If the execution proceeding is requested against the heirs, the proceeding must be suspended within the 3-month period, which is the mandated period for denial pursuant to the Turkish Civil Code. If the creditor wishes to continue the proceeding against the heritage, the following transactions must be made against the representative of the heritage, but the 3-month period will not be waited.

In some cases, it may be understood that the person shown as debtor in the follow-up request died before the follow-up date is ongoing and this error may need to be corrected. In this case, according to the Code of Civil Procedure, if it is understood that the debtor has died before the date of execution proceeding, the proceedings can be directed to the heirs in case it is determined that the proceeding is caused by a material error or the request for change of party is not contrary to the rule of honesty.
