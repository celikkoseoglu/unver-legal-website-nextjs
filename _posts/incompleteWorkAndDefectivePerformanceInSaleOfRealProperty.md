**Keywords:** Turkish Code of Obligations (TCO) No. 6098, defective performance, incomplete performance (deficient work), incomplete work, inspection and notice burden, contract of construction, the Court of Cassation (CoC)

The concept of incomplete work, which means that the performance is not fully fulfilled, can only be in question in terms of performance debts. Incomplete work occurs when one or more of the works decided to be done according to the construction contract and its annexes are not performed. In other words, while the work done in a defective performance was created in violation of the contract; incomplete work occurs when the work subject to the contract has never been done. 

The most important difference between incomplete work and defective performance is related to the inspection and notification burden, and in case of incomplete work, the landowner does not have the burden of inspection and notification. The landowner will be able to claim the damages incurred due to incomplete work within the scope of positive damage in accordance with article 112 of the TCO. In case of defective performance, the special provisions regulated in TCO article 474, and the following will be applied. 

Some of the kitchen cabinets or windows in the received building are not assembled or the elevator motor is not assembled as examples of incomplete works. However, if the elevator does not work since a part inside the engine was not put will be considered as defective performance. While incomplete work does not prevent the work from being received by the landowner/buyer, this is not accepted as a technical delivery. Since there is no technical delivery and there is no inspection and notification burden because of the unfinished part of the work, the owner of the work does not need to give notice.

The criterion used by Gauch in this distinction has been adopted by most writers in the doctrine. Accordingly, if the deficiencies in the structure can be eliminated without damaging the other parts, incomplete work will be occurred. However, if the elimination of the deficiency requires intervention and damage to other parts, defective performance will be mentioned. While explaining this criterion, the author gave an example that if a wall was not painted, as a rule, it would be an incomplete work. However, although the wall should be painted with primer paint first, it would be a defect if it was painted with normal paint without this paint. 

In a decision of the Court of Cassation, the lack of greening and the absence of solar collectors on the roof of the section connecting the two blocks on the site were considered as incomplete work. In another decision of the Plenary Assembly of the CoC, it accepted the ownership of some social areas in the site where the purchased real estate is located on another parcel that does not belong to the site as incomplete work and ruled that the seller will be liable for the damage suffered during the ten-year general statute of limitations. In another decision, the fact that the social facilities were built on the immovable belonging to TOKİ was accepted as incomplete work and it was decided that the plaintiff can sue the seller within the ten-year general statute of limitations.

On the other hand, the Court of Cassation changed this view after 2015 and created a contradictory situation that damaged the legal security. For example, it is accepted as a defective performance that the title deed of the sports complex promised to be built in the project is not given to the owners of the independent section and the facility is opened to the public. Therefore, in accordance with the consumer law in effect at that time, the defendants must be duly notified of the fault within thirty days from the delivery date, otherwise the case will be rejected. 

According to the authors, who argue that not obtaining a residence permit would be incomplete work, since the building is not legally complete without a residence permit. According to a similar view, obtaining a residence permit should qualify as a guarantee commitment and the buyer should be able to claim non-defective compensation. In our opinion, it is necessary to make a distinction between the deliberately not obtaining and not be able to obtaining. Accordingly, if the contractor undertook to obtain a residence permit but could not obtain this permit due to reasons such as being contrary to the project, this situation will be considered as a material defect in the form of breach of the contract. However, if there is no obstacle to obtain the permission, if this permission has not been obtained, the incomplete work should be mentioned. 

In construction contracts in return for land share, the obligation to obtain a residence permit is usually on the contractor. Even though according to Article 30 of the Law on Land Development Planning and Control numbered 3194, this issue is under the responsibility of the landowner, in practice, the parties agree that the residence permit will be obtained by the contractor when making the contract. The Court of Cassation also stated that the contractor is responsible for obtaining a residence permit, even if it is not agreed in the contract, based on the turnkey condition in the construction contracts in return for land share. 

The Court of Cassation accepts that if the independent sections of the landowner or common places are made smaller than the area agreed in the contract, the nature of this is incomplete work. The Court of Cassation bases these decisions on the fact that liability for defects is tied to strict conditions and short statute of limitations.
