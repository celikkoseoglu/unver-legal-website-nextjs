**Keywords:** The Turkish Condominium Law numbered 634 (KMK), flat ownership, property ownership, common expense, general expense, legal mortgage, delay compensation, priority right, compulsory transfer of ownership, Enforcement and Bankruptcy Law numbered 2004 (EBL), removal of objection, Turkish Code of Obligations (TCO) numbered 6098

Condominium order is a living space where many people live in relatively narrow areas and share common places, and it is inevitable to make various general expenses in order to maintain the common life in the desired way. The regular payment of the general expenses and the advances to be collected in order to meet this payment by the flat owners is a requirement for the regular fulfillment of the necessary and unavoidable joint works in the main building. There are effective enforcement tools and sanctions are envisaged in the KMK against the flat owners and co-responsible persons who do not fulfill their obligations. These measures, which have the nature of sanction for the owners who do not fulfill their debts, also have a deterrent effect for the other flat owners.

**Mentioned measures:**
•	Starting execution proceedings or filing a suit against the debtor flat owner/co-responsible persons,
•	Operating 5% monthly delay compensation,
•	The right to establish a legal mortgage on the flat of the flat owner who does not pay his debt,
•	Priority in receivables and
•	Forcing the flat owner to transfer the ownership of the flat 

**Litigation and Execution Proceeding:** General expense debt is related to the payment of some money, unless there is an agreement or a special situation to the contrary. Pursuant to Article 20/II of the KMK, a lawsuit can be filed, or execution proceedings can be carried out against the flat owner who does not pay the general expense or advance share, by each of the other flat owners or the building manager, in accordance with the management plan, KMK and general provisions. In order for a default to occur, as a rule, the debt must be due, not fulfilled, and the creditor must be warned in accordance with Article 117 of the TCO. However, in practice, since the monthly payment amount and payment date for the flats are determined in the operation project or the decision of the flat owners board, there is no longer any need for a warning to be made to the debtor in accordance with Article 117/2 of the TCO. Since the flat owner who does not fulfill his/her obligation to participate in the general expense or advance payment that is possible and due, he/she will be delayed in performance, even if he/she has not been in default. Therefore, a lawsuit may be filed, or enforcement proceedings may be initiated against him/her in accordance with the relevant provision of the KMK. The lawsuit is subject to a five-year statute of limitations, and if it is deemed necessary, judge may also impose a fine as an additional sanction pursuant to Article 33/2 of the KMK. The authority of the manager to file a lawsuit or follow the execution proceeding does not depend on whether the manager is a flat owner. Elected or appointed (by the court) the manager or board of directors can use this authority. In addition, the creditor's authority to accept the general expenses may be granted to third parties other than the manager. What is meant by enforcement proceedings is enforcement proceedings without judgment. There is an advantage provided to the creditor here. Accordingly, the finalized operating projects or the decisions of the flat owners board regarding the operating expenses will be counted among the documents specified in the EBL article 68/1, and if the debtor objects to the payment order, this project or decision will be considered as a debt note given by the debtor and the objection will be removed. 

Each owner is responsible for debts during his/her own ownership period (there are authors in the opposite opinion). The new owner is not responsible for the debts left over from the old period. In order for the new owner to be responsible for the old period, the debt must be undertaken under article 196 of the TCO or the existence of a participation of a debt institution under article 201 of the TCO. 

Persons benefiting from the flat on the basis of a real or relative right other than the right of ownership are held jointly and severally liable for general expenses, advance debt and delay compensation in accordance with Article 22/1 of the KMK. However, this situation is limited to persons who are tenants in the flat. The tenant's debt is limited to the amount of rent he/she is obliged to pay, and unless there is an agreement to the contrary, this price paid will be deducted from the rent debt. However, in practice, the parties generally agree that the tenant will pay the general expenses. 

**Delay Compensation:** The flat owner who does not pay his/her share of general expenses and advances is obliged to pay 5% monthly delay compensation in accordance with Article 20/2 of the KMK. The nature of compensation is controversial in the doctrine, and the Court of Cassation has conflicting decisions in this context. However, the Court of Cassation mostly decides the delay compensation that the flat owner is obliged to pay is not in the nature of interest, and this compensation is different from the default interest. In other words, the flat owner/co-responsible persons who do not pay their debts will be faced with a default interest and also 5% delay compensation. However, the calculation of this compensation will be made separately for each month and the delay compensation cannot be judged on the total of the delay compensation processed with the original receivable. It is possible to change the ratio. 

**Legal Mortgage (KMK Art. 22/2):** It is a legal right of mortgage subject to registration. Conditions required for it’s establishment: a) Condominium ownership has been established, b) The debt cannot be fulfilled despite applying to the flat owners or those who constantly benefit from the flat, c) The debt and amount of participation in the general expenses are determined by a court decision (or the owner recognizes the debt), d) Registration of the mortgage is required. The scope of the mentioned mortgage includes the general expenses and the uncollectible portion of the advance debt, delay compensation and execution expenses in accordance with the Turkish Civil Code article 875. The right to claim here is of a personal nature. In other words, if the flat owner who has not fulfilled his debt has transferred his/her flat before the mortgage is established, the new owner cannot be held responsible for this debt unless he/she undertakes this debt separately, and a legal mortgage cannot be established on the flat of the new owner (this issue is controversial and there are opinions to the contrary). This right cannot be waived beforehand, yet it can be waived after the right has arisen or the mortgage has been established. 

**Priority Right in Receivables (KMK Art. 22/3):** It is a provision applied to receivables that are not secured by mortgage. If the enforcement proceedings for the collection of the receivable are finalized and the debtor's assets are seized, the general expense receivable will participate in the lien with privilege. In accordance with Article 206 of the EBL, the general expense participation receivable is listed as a privileged receivable in the 3rd rank. 

**Compulsory Transfer of Ownership of the Flat (KMK Art. 25/3/a):** Compulsory transfer of property right (in the flat) of the flat owner, who has been sued or executed enforcement proceedings three times within two calendar years, can be requested from the court because of the non-payment of his/her general expenses. In case of non-performance of three different general expense debts, it is necessary to file three lawsuits or execute enforcement proceedings. If these conditions are fulfilled, the judge will not investigate whether the insufferable condition has been fulfilled or not but will decide on the transfer. The flat owners board will convene duly and it will be decided to file a lawsuit against the flat owner who violates his/her obligations. Quorum for meeting and decision for this is the majority of the flat owners number and land share. The lawsuit is filed where the main building is located and is subject to a five-year period of deprivation. If a lawsuit has been filed for the transfer of ownership of the flat before the lawsuit is concluded regarding the general expense debt, this situation is deemed to be a "preliminary issue" by the court.
