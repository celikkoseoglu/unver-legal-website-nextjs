**Keywords:** Decision numbered HGK E. 2017/17-3076, K. 2018/498 and dated 21/March/2018, Bailment Contract, Liability of Valet, recourse compensation arising from motor damage insurance agreement, Possession as Safe, Turkish Code of Obligations (TCO)

Because of the area of usage of motor vehicles in our lives today, it is a crystal-clear fact that parking lots, valet parking and similar services have become indispensable for citizens. Those who leave their motor vehicles to such places have a justifiable confidence in the relevant business and the owners of these businesses that their vehicles will be preserved until they take back their vehicles. This issue has been specifically regulated in the Turkish Code of Obligations, number 6098. Article 579 of TCO bears the title of "The responsibility of those who operate garages, parking lots and similar places" and it is stipulated that those who operate garages, parking lots and similar places will be responsible for the destruction, damage or theft of motor vehicles and their attachments left to them or received by their employees. In practice, while determining the responsibility of the garage and parking lot operators, different from the above article, the decision is made based on the bailment agreement and general provisions. (V. decision  of the 13th Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation numbered E. 2003/5039, K.2003 / 8870, dated 01/July/2003)

According to the Plenary Assembly of the Court of Cassation, the owner of the vehicle hands over the vehicle to the parking valet (or parking attendant, car park attendant, etc.) with the belief that the vehicle will be parked in a safe place and the keys will be kept securely. After the vehicle has been delivered to the valet for parking, the valet will park the vehicle properly, lock the vehicle in accordance with the care obligation of the bailment contract and after checking that the doors are locked, ensure that the key is kept in a place that cannot be reached by any other person or persons. After fulfilling all these contractual obligations, the valet is allowed to deal with other customers' vehicles. In summary, according to the contract established between the parties, the valet has to take every precaution to prevent the vehicle from being stolen.

The lawsuit subject to the decision of the Plenary Assembly is about the request for annulment of the objection to the execution proceedings initiated by the insurance company to the defendant parking lot operator and the defendant parking lot attendant for the recourse of the amount paid to the vehicle owner due to the insurance contract. In the case, the insured vehicle owner, who came to the restaurant operated by the defendant at night, delivered the vehicle to the car park attendant and entered the restaurant. The vehicle with the key on it was stolen by unidentified persons about 45 minutes later when the parking lot attendant was dealing with another customer's vehicle. Defendants are obliged to take every precaution to prevent the delivered vehicle from being taken or stolen by others in accordance with the provisions of the Turkish Code of Obligations. From the documents within the scope of the file, it has been determined that the parking area is within the control area of the relevant enterprise. In this case, after the vehicle is delivered to the attendant to be parked, the parking attendant must park the vehicle properly and fully fulfill the obligations of the bailment contract. The insured vehicle owner acted with this trust and with the belief that the vehicle would be parked in a safe place and the keys would be kept securely. In addition, keeping the vehicle together with its keys for 45 minutes is against the usual flow of life. In accordance with the contractual liabilities between the parties and regulations regarding succession, the defendants will be responsible for the damage incurred.
