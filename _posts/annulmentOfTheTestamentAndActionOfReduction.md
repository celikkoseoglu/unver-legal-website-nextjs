###### November 01, 2021 - 20 min read

###### Keywords: annulment of the will (testament), challenging the formal validity of the will, heritage, reserved portion (share in the inheritance), testamentary disposition 

In our law, the power of testamentary disposition is not unlimited for the person who will leave an inheritance and is subject to some regulations. A gradual lawsuit should be filed, that is, if the annulment of the will request that is the subject of the lawsuit is not accepted, a decision should be made for reduction in terms of the reserved portions. 

The action for annulment, which can be filed for a part or all the testament, is a lawsuit that creates a disruptive innovation and has retroactive consequences. The lawsuit filed will only bind the parties to the lawsuit and will not be valid for those who do not file a lawsuit.

According to the law, a testament can be terminated in the existence of the following reasons:
1. If the testament was made at a time when the legator did not have the capacity to dispose,
2. If the testament was made as a result of mistake, deception, intimidation or coercion,
3. If the content of the testament, the conditions to which it is linked or the attributions are against the law or morality,
4. If the testament was made without complying with the forms prescribed by law.

An action for annulment may be filed by the heir or the beneficiary of the testament, who has an interest in the annulment of the testament. The lawsuit will be about the annulment of all or specific part of the testament. However, if the action for annulment has been filed because it has contributed to the persons who participated in the making of the testament, their spouses, or relatives, only these gains will be annulled, rather than the entire testament. The competent court is the Civil Court of First Instance and the case is filed in the court of the last settlement of the testator. 

Testaments are a disposition subject to reduction and the action of reduction is a case that must be filed by the heir with a reserved portion. The Action of Reduction is also a case that brings about formative right, and some gains made by the testator become partially or completely invalid as of the opening of the inheritance. If the reserved portions of the heirs who have reserved portion are damaged as a result of the savings of the testator, the relevant savings will only be valid for the part other than these reserved portions. Here, the heir with the reserved portion requests that the testament will be reduced from the extent rate that it violates the reserved portion. The reduction will be made from the testamentary savings first, and if this is not sufficient, it will be made from the savings made testator’s lifetime (inter vivos) by going from the most recent to the oldest until the reserved portion is completed. 

The concept of reserved portion is limited to the persons and ratios listed in the law. The testator can save on death only for the part other than these reserved rates. Pursuant to article 506 of the Turkish Civil Code numbered 4721, the heirs with reserved portions and their rates are as follows: 
1. Half of the legal inheritance share for the descendant,
2. One quarter of the legal inheritance share for each of the parents,
3. For the spouse, if she is an heir with descendants or parents, the entire legal inheritance share; and in other cases it is three quarters of the legal inheritance share. 

In order to be able to mention that the reserved portion is damaged, the inheritance subject to gain and the non-gained heritage must be known in full. For this, all records and documents related to the heritage must be brought to the file. The title deed records, and other documents of the inherited immovables are determined ex officio by the Court. Whether the testator damages the reserved portion in terms of the heirs or not is calculated over the "net succession". The value of the net succession will be found by deducting the debits from the asset of the heritage. After the net succession is found, the plaintiffs' inheritance shares will be found on the net estate, and then their reserved portions will be determined.

######Assets: It is the gains made by the testator on the date of death, subject to equalization and reduction. The value of the assigned and non-assignable immovables is calculated on the basis of the values on the death date of the testator.

######Debits: Debts of the testator, funeral expenses, sealing and the writing expenses of the heritage, and the three-month subsistence expenses of those who live with the testator and are cared for by him. 

If the property subject to savings is a property that cannot be divided without a decrease in its value, the Defendant may request that the property be given to him/her by paying the value of the rate that needs to be reduced, or the money that meets the value of the saved part. This optional right is given to the Defendant by the court. 

According to the Court of Cassation, in the nature of the action of reduction is an action for performance, and at the end of the lawsuit, the plaintiff, whose reserved portion is violated, does not need to file a separate performance action. In order for this lawsuit to be filed, the testator must be dead. Possible plaintiffs are heirs with reserved portions, creditors of heirs with reserved shares and the Administration of Bankruptcy. The defendants are the beneficiaries of the dispositions subject to reduction. The right to file an action of reduction is one year starting from the date on which the heirs learn that their reserved portions have been damaged and, in any case, ten years from the date of the opening of the testament. The point to be noted here is that the 10-year period starts from the date of opening the testament. Opening an inheritance and opening a testament are not the same thing. The opening of the inheritance happens at the time of death, but the opening of the testament is not the time of death. The competent court for the opening of the testament is Civil Court of Peace and it is opened within one month from the delivery of the testament.
