# The Obligation to Express the Demand to be Based on the Proof by Oath

### Decision of the General Assembly of the Unification of Case Law of the Court of Cassation

### “The Statement of Other Evidence Cannot Be Construed as Based on Evidence of Oath”

###### March 01, 2022 - 20 min read

The problem that came before and needs to be resolved by the General Assembly of the Unification of Case Law of the Court of Cassation is that whether the phrases such as "other evidence, all kinds of evidence, and other evidence" in the petitions and the evidence lists of the parties in the lawsuits can be accepted that the parties rely on the proof by oath, and in this context, whether it is possible for the judge to remind the party on the burden of proof of his/her right to offer the proof by oath after the Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) numbered 6100 came into force.

Although CCP regulates the oaths of witnesses, experts and parties as separate institutions, it has not defined the proof by oath. Conceptually, an oath means "to verify an event by showing God or a holy person or something as a witness" (TDK Current Turkish Dictionary). From the point of view of the CCP, an oath is the declaration of one of the parties on whether a fact is true or not, on his/her honor, and all his/her beliefs and values that he/she considers sacred.

Evidence is shown by the parties as a rule, and this is called the principle of being brought by the parties. Pursuant to article 194 of the CCP, it is obligatory for the parties to clearly state the evidence they rely on, and which evidence is shown to prove which fact. On the other hand, the judge has the duty to enlighten the case. Accordingly, the judge will be able to have the parties make explanations, ask questions and demand evidence about matters that he deems ambiguous or contradictory in material or legal terms, when clarification of the conflict necessitates it. However, it is necessary to understand this duty as being limited to claim and defense, as foreseen to eliminate ambiguity and contradictions and with the aim of reaching the truth. Because the duty of the judge to enlighten the case is an institution related to the principle of being brought by the parties. Therefore, the judge does not have the authority to remind certain evidence within the framework of his/her duty to enlighten the case. 

In addition, pursuant to Article 119/1 of the CCP titled "content of the lawsuit petition", the plaintiff is under the obligation to show clear summaries of all the facts on which his/her claim is based, under the serial number, and with what evidence he/she will prove each case he/she claims. This obligation is repeated in article 194/2 of the same law titled "concrete burden and presentation of evidence" and in article 318/1 titled "substitution of evidence" in terms of simple trial procedure. A similar burden is placed on the defendant in terms of the reasons and means of defense in Article 124 titled "content of the reply petition". The parties will be able to put forward the grounds of claim and defense until a certain stage of the proceedings, after which the grounds of claim and defense will not be considered by the court.

CCP listed the evidence as voucher, oath, witness, expert, viewing and expert opinion. However, the evidence is not limited to the ones listed in the law, and in cases where the law does not impose an obligation to prove with a certain matter of evidence, the parties may also refer to other evidence that are not regulated in the law. Evidence is divided into two as "conclusive evidence" and "discretionary evidence". Conclusive evidences are four: acknowledgment, final judgment, promissory note and oath. Conclusive evidence is binding on the judge, and the judge must accept a case confirmed by one of the definitive proofs as proven. Therefore, if an oath is sworn whether a fact is true or not, there will no longer be any need to show any other evidence about that fact, and whether that fact is true or not will be definitively proven in the case. 

Evincing is not an obligation; it is a burden. Burden is a duty that the legal order imposes on a person against another person, and if this duty is not fulfilled, the person who bears the burden either cannot gain a right that is possible to obtain or loses such a right. 

The burden of proof will be made by the party that falls on the proof by oath. Accordingly, if the party whose burden of proof falls on him cannot prove that fact with other evidence, he will be able to offer an oath to the other party.

The General Assembly concluded that the legislator imposes the burden of clear statement which evidence is presented to the parties for the proof of which fact. Therefore, the party does not have the right to propose an oath unless the evidence of the oath is clearly relied on.

Accordingly, the parties' use of phrases such as "other evidence, all kinds of evidence, and other evidence" cannot be interpreted as clearly relying on the proof by oath, and it will not be possible for the judge to remind the parties of their right to offer an oath.
