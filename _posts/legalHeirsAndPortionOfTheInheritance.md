# Legal Heirs and Portion of the Inheritance

### Persons Who Can Be Legal Heirs and Their Inheritance Shares

###### December 01, 2021 - 20 min read

Briefly, the heir is the person who has the right to the inheritance of the inheritor as a universal successor. Universal successors gain the inheritance of the person who left the inheritance as a whole and spontaneously. Universal successors will also be jointly and severally liable for the debts of the deceased. Heirs are divided into two as legal or appointed heirs according to the reason behind their being heirs. Legal heirs, who are the subject of our bulletin, are individuals who are called to inherit by law. Legal heirs are blood relatives, the surviving spouse and the State. However, the adopter and its descendant will inherit the adopter like blood relatives. In our law, the parental system has been adopted in the legal inheritance of blood relatives. We have listed the groups below. However, if the inheritor has a surviving spouse, the surviving spouse will inherit in any case, that is, with the three groups below. 

I.  The first group is the descendant of the inheritor. The legal inheritance portion of the surviving spouse, who is the heir with the first group, becomes ¼.

II. The second group is the parents of the inheritor and their descendants, namely the siblings of the inheritor, children of siblings, grandchildren of siblings etc. These people are the second group, unlimited downwards and sideways. The legal inheritance portion of the surviving spouse, who is the heir with the second group, becomes ½.

III.  The third group is the grandparents and their descendants of the inheritor (eg., the uncle, aunt, and their descendants of the inheritor), again downwards and sideways, without any limitation. The legal inheritance portion of the surviving spouse, who is the heir with the third group, becomes ¾. However, in the third group, there is a special arrangement to protect the surviving spouse. Pursuant to Article 497/5 of the TMK, in the event that the surviving spouse and the third group are heirs and the grandparents die, the aunt, uncle and aunt can be the heirs at most. According to the principle of succession, the entire inheritance will go to the surviving spouse, and not to the cousins.

The first point to be considered here is the necessity of being included in a group in order to be an heir. For example, the parents of the inheritor's grandparents are not heirs because they do not form a parental system, although they are blood relatives. In addition, in the biological sense, blood relation is not sufficient to be an heir from the father's side, legal relation, that is, lineage, must be established. While the relation is established by birth from the mother's side, if a child is born out of wedlock from the father's side, a lineage bond must be established between the child and the father. Finally, it should be noted that in-laws can never be legal heirs.

The second important point to be considered is that if there is an heir in the previous group, the next group cannot be the heir. Even the existence of a single heir in a group prevents the next group from being called to inherit. In order for the next group to be an heir, there must be no heir in the previous group, or the existing heirs must not inherit due to reasons such as waiver of the inheritance, rejection of the inheritance, loss, deprivation. The important thing here is not the degree of blood relation but being included in the previous group. For example, the grandchild of the inheritor is third degree, the mother and father of the inheritor are first degree blood relatives. However, since the grandchild of the inheritor is in the first group if he is qualified to inherit, it will prevent the inheritance of the parents of the inheritor, who are the heirs of the second group.

If there is an heir at the first rank in the group, the inheritance does not pass to the heirs of the lower rank. In other words, if the son or daughter of the inheritor is alive and capable of inheritance, and there are also grandchildren of the inheritor, the son or daughter of the inheritor will be the legal heir. Finally, let us state that the person who dies before the inheritor or whose heirship was hindered in any legit way (even if he is alive), will be replaced by his descendants. This is called the principle of succession within the root. 
Let's explain all this with a few examples. Let's say M to the legator, A and B to his mother and father, BA and BB to his grandparents, E to his wife, C1 and C2 to his children, T1 and T2 to his grandchildren:

Whether M is dead, divorced before her death and there is no surviving spouse, M's only two children named C1 and C2, their inheritance shares are distributed as ½. If C2 died before M and left behind his/her grandchildren named T1 and T2, the share that will fall to C2 is distributed equally to her children, in this case C1 has ½ and T1 ¼ and T2 have ¼ shares. The surviving spouse of C2 does not inherit because relatives in-law cannot be legal heirs. 

M is dead, his surviving spouse E, his children C1 and C2, his grandchildren T1 and T2, remain. Let C2 died before M. In this case, 1/4 of the inheritance goes to the surviving spouse. The remaining ¾ of shares should be distributed equally to C1 and C2, so C1 remains 3/8, but since C2 died before M, he will have 3/8 of it, equally divided among his children T1 and T2. T1 and T2 each have 3/16 shares. 

M is dead, there is no remaining spouse or children, but his mother A and father B be alive. The inheritance remains with the second estate and is divided equally, that is, M's mother A and father B have ½ shares. Since the heads of the group are now M's mother and father here, as long as they are alive and capable of inheritance, the inheritance does not belong to their descendants, namely M's siblings. 

M is dead, he has no wife or children, his mother and father died before M, only his father's father BB, his father's mother BA and his mother's mother AA are left behind. The ½ share that will be left to M's father will be equally distributed to BB and BA, and their share will be 1/4. The ½ share that will be left to M's mother will go directly to AA since there is no one else. 
M is dead, has no children, but the surviving spouse (E) and M's mother and father remain. E will be shared at the rate of ½, and A and B at the rate of ¼ respectively. 

M is dead, he has no children, but the surviving spouse (E) and M's mother's mother, mother's father, father's father and father's mother are alive. 3/4 will be shared for E, 1/16 for AA, AB, BB and BA.

M is dead, he has no wife, he has three children, but let's say the third is adopted. In accordance with the Turkish Civil Code, since the adoption will be heirs like blood relatives, all three children will have a share of 1/3. However, it should be noted that the adopter and his relatives cannot be heirs to the adopted child. In other words, if the adopted son had died before, the inheritance of the adopted son would not have passed to M.

In order for the State to be an heir, the deceased must not leave behind a legal or appointed heir. For example, in case M has died and he has no legal heirs, but has left all of his estate to his best friend with a valid inheritance contract or will, then the State cannot be the heir.
