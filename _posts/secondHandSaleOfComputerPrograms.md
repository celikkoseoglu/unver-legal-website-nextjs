**Precedent:** the 11th Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation, decision numbered E. 2014/17376, K. 2015/8772, dated 30/June/2015

The exhaustion doctrine, which is one of the most fundamental boundaries of the right of distribution, is an issue that evaluated and discussed at different levels in computer programming according to the way of acquisition and transfer: a) transfer of the program with its carrier, b) separately from the carrier c) obtained from the Internet 

Following the "UsedSoft" decision, in which the European Court of Justice (ECJ) accepted the exhaustion doctrine in terms of computer programs, the issue has become widely discussed. Detailed examination and understanding of Verisil v. Microsoft decision, which is the first example related to this field in Turkish law, is an extremely important object for both the Turkish legal community and the second-hand market. 

The intellectual property rights of the creator is related to the work, are financial and moral rights. The right of distribution is a financial right and it is regulated in LIAW Article 23. Accordingly, the right to rent, lend, sell and distribute the original or duplicated copies of a work belongs to the owner of the work. According to the dominant view in the doctrine, the right of distribution occurs in samples of works that have material assets. For this reason, the acquisition of the work via the internet is not considered within the scope of the right of distribution, but within the scope of the "communication to the public" right regulated in LIAW Article 25. 

The “exhaustion doctrine" is one of the fundamental boundaries related to the right of distribution. In accordance with the EU Directive and the LIAW parallel to this, the right of distribution on the work will expire after the first sale and distribution, and the owner of the work will not be able to prevent the further publication of the work. In order to mention the exhaustion doctrine, it must be accepted that the owner of the work has acted with the intention of releasing his/her dominance over the copy of the work and transferring the work. In such cases the work is leased or lent to the public, the exhaustion doctrine will not be applied since there is no cessation of dominance or final transfer. 

The transfer of the work copy should be a transfer in terms of both the law of property and the law of intellectual and artistic works. Secondly, the owner’s consent must be obtained in accordance with the purpose of the exhaustion doctrine. In the transfer of property, there is basically a single transaction in terms of both law of property and the law of intellectual and artistic works, but the transfer of ownership does not always appear in the same or overlapping way in terms of these two legal fields. In terms of law of property, there is no obligation such as exhaustion of the right of distribution on the work copy in every transfer. For example, in the transfer of the work copy for the purpose of collateral, the exhaustion doctrine is realized only when the conditions for converting the collateral into money exist. Therefore, the transfer should aim to gain an economic, cultural, artistic or literary benefit. In case, transfer of the work copies handled with the purpose of “destroy” cannot be considered as a transfer that will allow the application of the exhaustion doctrine. 

The owner of the work has the right to protect his / her own interests along with to benefit from his / her work as much as possible by the nature of financial rights. However, after the original or copy of the work has been transferred with the consent of the owner of the work, there is no material justification that requires the owner of the work to get a reward for the further publications. A contrary view will have unfair consequences that ignores public interests and allows the owner to affect the second-hand market. Because the exhaustion doctrine aims to strike a balance between the protection of copyrights and fair competition. 

The incident subject relates to whether the exhaustion doctrine is applicable in the transfer of the program to someone else, whether the transfer restriction clause in the licence agreement made in the debt relationship underlying the first transfer is valid or not. Plaintiff Verisil buys the Defendant’s (Microsoft) products that it puts on the market through box or OEM sales from computer users and resells them. Whilst doing this, Verisil removes the authenticity label on the computer (and also deletes the name of the computer company) and stick it on the recovery CD. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit to determine that the reintroduction of second-hand products into the market in this way is legal. 

Microsoft has stipulated a transfer restriction regarding the transfer of the program in a clause of its licence agreement with computer companies. Accordingly, OEM versions can only be sold with the hardware (computer), and it is prohibited to sell the program separately from the computer on which it is installed to. 

The defendant (Microsoft) stated that the licence transfer is a simple certification transfer and cannot be subject to a sales agreement based on the relevant article in the licence agreement. Since the rights of the use of computer programs are granted to computer companies or third companies through a licence agreement, the program can only be transferred under the licence agreement if certain conditions are met. Therefore, according to the defendant, those who acquire the program cannot save on programs in this way. 

The court of first instance stated that the sale of a program loaded onto computer was not a compulsory technical procedure. Instead, this was merely the marketing strategy of the company that developed the computer programs, and it was a commercial option. 

According to the court, there is no difference in terms of the rights on the program between the user who bought a computer and installs the program obtained from the market to it and the user who purchased the computer with the program. The distribution type does not affect the exhaustion of the right. For this reason, the distribution and installation of the programs in the form of OEM and box sales is technically the same. In OEM sales, the first buyer of the product is the computer (hardware) company, while the first buyer in box sales is the distributors. 

According to the court, the intervention right of the owner in the circulation of the products that are put into the commercial life after the distribution with the consent of the right owner is possible only in cases where the specific issue (object specifique) justifies. There is no such situation in this case. 

The court, referring to the ECJ’s UsedSoft decision, decided that the first transfer of the computer program sample with the licence agreement was the first sale because of the right of distribution was exhausted and that it would be valid for both types of distribution without any difference. 

According to the court, the authenticity label and instruction book are an integral part of the program. In the separation and resale of the program installed on the computer, sticking the label on the CD that carries the program guarantees the originality of the program. Eventually, the court ruled that Verisil's selling, or licensing second-hand software did not infringe Microsoft's intellectual property rights. 

It is accurate that the court decided that there should be no difference between the licence agreement and the sales agreement, and the concluded licence agreement should be treated as the first sale and that the exhaustion doctrine has been realized. Because, in the ECJ decision cited, it is emphasized that the authority to update the sample of the work (update), correction of the errors or similar qualifications should be used by those who takes over the program later. These rights are granted to the licence itself. 

It is also accurate that the transfer restriction provision is invalid. Because the provision in the licence agreement describes the compulsory sale prohibited by the Act on The Protection of Competition numbered 4054. Because a computer is sold to the consumer who wants to take over the program, even if the consumer does not need a computer. The provision that prohibits the transfer of the original program separately from the computer in certain circumstances where there are no cases such as imitation / copying, is a provision that aims to keep the second-hand market under control and has no legal basis in this regard, which is not related to intellectual property rights. It is worth noting that if a compulsory copy is made during the installation, it must be deleted or rendered unusable as an obligation. Otherwise, there will be two separate program examples, therefore a risk of unfair duplication will be faced.
