The institution of assignment (transfer) of claim, regulated between articles 183-194 of the TCO, is the transfer of an existing receivable (claim) without the consent of the debtor, based on a contract, which causes changing the creditor. As a result of this transfer, the right to claim passes to the third party who has taken over the claim. The transferee of the receivable is not the representative of the transferor, but now becomes the creditor himself and gains the authority to dispose of the receivable. However, since this transaction is a type of three-party relations, it also involves some risks. Because the transferee does not have the opportunity to control what he bought, as in the sale contract. Examples of such risks are the fact that the transferred receivable is not actually born or will not arise in the future, or that it has expired at the time of the transfer even though it was born. In addition, since the transferee of the claim is dealing with the debtor, who is a person whom the transferee does not know, most of the time, there is a risk that the transferee will not be able to collect the receivable, even if the receivable is validly transferred in case the debtor does not have the ability to pay. The legislator, who wants to prevent such inconveniences, has regulated the guarantee responsibility of the person who transfers the receivable in return for a performance. The basic idea here is the need to protect the transferee of a receivable that does not have a physical property. The person who transfers the receivable without a performance does not have any guarantee responsibility. Because of that, in this case the transferor party has given up the expectation of that receivable in favor of the transferee. In terms of the transferee, there is no risk in the assignment of claim. Whereas, in a transfer in return for a performance, the person who takes over the receivable takes a risk by sacrificing a certain response for a receivable that he has not yet collected. Pursuant to article 191/1 of the TCO, the transferor guarantees against the transferee that the receivable exists during the transfer and that the debtor has the ability to pay. Here, the legislator has imposed an independent guarantee liability on the transferor whether it is in fault or not. However, if the receivable is transferred without taking any performance in return or passed on to someone else as required by law, the transferor or the previous creditor will not be responsible for the existence of the receivable and the solvency of the debtor.

Being responsible for the existence of the receivable means that the receivable has arisen or will arise in the future and has not expired during the transfer. For example, if the debtor makes a statute of limitations or non-payment defense against the transferee or terminates the contract in which the claim arises, the transferee cannot obtain the claim. In this context, the transferor, who is responsible for the existence of the receivable, will be responsible even if he does not know the debtor's defenses or the non-existence of the receivable. However, it should be noted that if the debtor, who has the ability to pay even though an existing debt has been transferred according to the procedure, does not pay his debt, the guarantee liability of the transferor does not arise. Because the transferee party is obliged to make the mandatory proceedings for the collection of this receivable in accordance with the provisions of the law. If the transferee has not been able  to collect his receivables despite fulfilling his obligations, then the debtor will be deemed to be incapable of paying and the transferor's guarantee liability will come to the fore.

 In return for a performance to be taken, the transferee may make the following demands from the transferor who is under the guarantee liability:

 The transferee can request the return of the performance performed by the transferor together with the interest. Here, the scope of liability is not the amount of receivable (claim) transferred but is limited to the amount of counter performance received. The transferor must return this amount with interest.

 Secondly, the expenses caused by the transfer are also covered by the guarantee. In addition, inconclusive enforcement proceedings and expenses incurred as a result of litigation are also covered by the guarantee. Unless the transferor proves his faultlessness, other damages incurred are also within this scope. 

 In addition, if the transferor of the receivable has committed a tort due to his behavior, the transferee will be able to claim the damage suffered separately in accordance with the provisions of the tortious act.

 However, it should be noted that the provisions regarding the guarantee liability of the transferor of the receivable in return for a performance are not mandatory but default rule. In other words, the parties will be able to pass the risks imposed by the law on the transferor to the transferee by making agreements contrary to these provisions.
