### “Types of Wills in Turkish Law and Their Validity Conditions”

###### Keywords: testament, will, holograph will, official will, nuncupative will, favor testamenti

A testament (referred to herein as “will”) is a testamentary disposition in the procedural sense and is a unilateral legal transaction. In order to make a will, it is necessary to have completed the age of 15 and to have the power of discernment. On the other hand, the principle of "favor testamenti" is valid in our law system. According to this principle, the wishes of the deceased are protected as much as possible. In other words, even if the listed conditions are not complied with, its sanction is not absolute nullity, but revocability. There are three types of wills;

#### Holograph Will (aka Handwriten): 
From the beginning to the end, it has to be written in the handwriting of the legator, signed by the person himself/herself, and the year, month and day of the will must be shown. However, it is sufficient that the date can be determined without hesitation, it is not mandatory to specify a date as MM/DD/YY.

#### Official Will: 
It is a more advantageous type as it involves official authorities and cannot remain confidential, unlike a holograph will. Official wills are divided into two as “will made without being read and signed by the legator” and “will made by reading and signing”. In order to make this will, the presence of an authorized officer (such as notary public, magistrate, consulate, but in practice it is usually carried out by notaries) and two witnesses are required. However, there are some limitations in terms of being an officer and witness. Pursuant to Article 536 of the Turkish Civil Code numbered 4721, those who do not have the capacity to act, are banned from public service, illiterate, the spouse of the legator, their lower and upper blood relatives, siblings, and their spouses cannot be present as officers or witnesses in the preparation of the will. If they are found in this process, the will becomes completely revocable. In addition, the officers and witnesses who participated in the preparation of the official will, their superior and low blood relatives, siblings and spouses of these people will not be able to earn any acquisition with that will. In this case, if a benefit has been made to the persons listed, only this part of the savings is revoked, not the will entirety. In the will “read and signed”, the legator informs the official of his/her wishes. Thereupon, the officer writes/prints the will and gives it to the legator for reading and signing. After it is signed by the legator, the officer signs the will with a date. After this procedure, the legator explains to two witnesses in the presence of the officer that he read the will and that it contains his last wishes. Witnesses also write in the will that this statement was made in front of them, and that the legator is capable of disposition and sign it. The content of the will read and signed is not mandatory to be disclosed to the witnesses. In a will made “without being read and signed by the legator”, the legator informs the officer of his declarations and the officer prepares the text of the will in accordance with these declarations. Thereupon, the officer reads the testament to the legator in front of two witnesses and then declares that the testator's “last wishes” include his last wishes. Subsequently, the witnesses stated that the statement of the decedent was made in front of them and they saw him/her as competent; they also sign the will, declaring that the will is read by the officer to the legator in front of them and that the will contains legator’s last wishes. Here, the witnesses also learn the content of the will. If the person is not literate, he has to make this will, while those who are literate have the right to choose. 

#### Nuncupative Will: 
It takes place in extraordinary and exceptional circumstances. Therefore, its application is subject to strict conditions. The first condition is the existence of a state of emergency. These situations are imminent danger of death, illness, interruption of transportation, and war. The second condition is that due to this extraordinary situation, it is not possible to apply to other types of wills. The legator tells his last wishes to two witnesses and assigns them the task of writing or dictating a will in accordance with this statement. Here, the witnesses testify that they consider the legator is competent to make a will and that he/she told them his/her last wishes in an emergency. Except for the condition of being literate in the preparation of the official will, the prohibitions regarding the witnesses will also apply to the witnesses in the nuncupative will. In the first case, the witnesses listen to the legator, put legator’s last wishes into a text by reconciliation, and give it to the magistrate by writing the date and place of signature. In the second case, the witnesses can apply to the court without delay and declare the counted issues and have the last wishes of the legator recorded in a report.
