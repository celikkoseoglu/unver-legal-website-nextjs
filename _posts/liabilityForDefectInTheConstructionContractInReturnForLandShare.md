**Keywords:** Turkish Code of Obligations (TBK) No. 6098, defect, clear defect, latent (hidden) defect, important defect, termination of contract, reduction in price, right to repair, deficient work, unfulfilled performance, guarantee agreement, additional work, inspection and notice burden, contract of construction, contractor, optional rights 

The contractor is under the obligation to create and deliver a defect-free building to the landowner, in the construction contract, in return for land share. If the contractor violates this debt, he/she will be liable to the landowner in accordance with the provisions of the TBK article 474 and the following, regarding the contract of construction. Deficient (incomplete) work, warranty contract, unfulfilled performance and additional work will not be considered as a defect. The most important difference between deficient work and defective performance is related to the inspection and notification burden, and in case of deficient work, the landowner does not have the burden of inspection and notification. The landowner will be able to claim the damages incurred due to deficient work within the scope of positive damage in accordance with article 112 of the TBK.

In order for the contractor to be liable for the defect, in addition to the existence of a defect in the building, some other conditions must be met. First, the building must be delivered. In construction contracts in return for land share, delivery is carried out if the contractor explicitly or implicitly notifies that the construction work has been completed. Even though the delivery is not subject to any form condition, in practice it is subject to turnkey basis or obtaining a residence permit.

After the delivery, the inspection and notification burdens of the landowner begin. The burden of inspection and notification is the second condition that must be fulfilled in order for the contractor to be liable for the defect. In terms of clear (obvious) defects, the landowner must fulfill the inspection burden as soon as possible according to the ordinary course of business after delivery and notify the contractor of these defects, if any. Latent (hidden) defects should be reported to the contractor without delay as soon as they are discovered, otherwise the landowner will be deemed to have accepted the work implicitly and will not be able to apply to the provisions of liability for defects. Clear defects are defects that the buyer can detect with a regular inspection at the time of delivery of the work, and that the buyer can notice as soon as he/she examines the work with a glance. Latent defects are those that are not seen during the proper review of the building, but are discovered later, usually during its use. A significant defect occurs when the building is so defective that it cannot be used by the owner of the land or, as a matter of good faith, the landlord cannot be forced to accept it. This type of defect is important in determining the optional rights to be used by the landowner. In discordance with the sales contract, according to article 475/1 of the TBK, the owner of the work has the right to terminate the contract only for significant defects. In case of less important defects, reduction in price or right to repair may apply.

In addition to these conditions, the mentioned defect should not arise from a reason to be attributed to the landowner, the landowner should not explicitly or implicitly accept the defective building, and the statute of limitations should not have passed. Attribution to the landowner occurs in cases where a defect occurs as a result of the definite and binding instructions given by the landowner to the contractor regarding the execution of the work, or when the defect is loaded to the landowner for any reason other than the instruction (such as the material provided by the landowner, the plan/project prepared by the landowner). In the statute of limitations, the period is five years and will start from the delivery date of the building or flats. However, if the defect in the structure is caused by the contractor's gross negligence, the statute of limitations to be applied is 20 years.

In the event that the aforementioned conditions are fulfilled, the landowner will have some optional rights against the contractor and the right to compensation independently of them. The first of the optional rights is the right to terminate the contract. However, the acceptance of the other party or a court decision in this direction is required in order to terminate from the contract. In order to use the right of termination, the building must be defective to the extent that it cannot be used objectively and subjectively, or there must be a defect that cannot be expected from the landowner as a matter of good faith, or it must be contrary to the provisions of the construction contract, in accordance with Article 475/1 of the TBK. However, if the demolition of the structure will cause excessive damage, the right of termination will no longer be exercised. On the other hand, if the defects prevent usage or create a dangerous situation, the contract can be terminated regardless of excessive damage. With the termination, the contract expires retroactively and the parties' obligations to return arises.

The second optional right that the landowner can use is the right of deduction from the price. Absolute discount method, cost-based calculation method, proportional method or compensation method can be used in calculating the deduction amount. The Court of Cassation decides using the proportional method.

The last optional right that the landowner can exercise is the right to demand the removal of the defect (right to repair). In order for this right to be exercised, there must be a lack of objective market value in the structure due to the defect, but this value difference should not completely eliminate the value of the structure. 

In addition to these optional rights, the landowner also has the opportunity to demand compensation according to the general provisions. The landowner can make a claim for compensation either with one of the optional rights or independently of them. The landowner is not obliged to comply with the inspection and notification burdens for the claim for compensation, but the contractor must be at fault. Finally, due to the fact that construction contracts in return for land share create a three-party relationship, in some cases, landowners who are not a party to the contract but establish a justified trust with the buyers are held liable to third parties due to the liability of confidence. This matter was explained in our bulletin dated May 01, 2021.
