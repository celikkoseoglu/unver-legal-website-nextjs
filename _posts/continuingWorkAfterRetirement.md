> Previous terms of workers who continue to work in the same workplace after retirement are liquidated, their seniority rights are nullified and a new employment contract occurs between the parties.

It is possible for a person to continue to work in the same workplace after retirement and receive severance pay for the period that he/she has worked. In terms of the Labor Law No. 4857, there is no difference between employees who continue work after retirement and other employees, and the rights of retired employees are not restricted. Persons who continue to work after their retirement will be entitled to severance pay just like all other employees in case, they terminate their employment contract (resigning with just cause) or are dismissed by the employer, and if the conditions are met, they will be entitled to notice pay.

In practice, it is common to work in the same workplace after retirement. It should be noted that individuals whose insurance entries were made before the 1st of October 2008 may continue to receive their pensions by paying SSSC, but these people whose first employment dates are after this date, will not be able to work by paying SSSC when they retire, they must cut their pensions and then they are allowed to work.

The severance rights of these people who leave their jobs by receiving their severance pay and continue to work in the same workplace are reset, their previous working period is liquidated, and a new employment contract is established between the parties and as a result of this, the date they start working for the second time is accepted as the beginning of the new service period. In the event that the employee leaves the job, the severance pay is calculated over the period after retirement and the condition of the completion of the one-year minimum period will again be required.

According to the Court of Cassation, the worker's post-retirement work at the same workplace is a new employment relationship and the contract is a new employment contract. Thereby, with the retirement, the previous period of the employee is liquidated and the date he/she starts working for the second time is accepted as the service period.

On the other hand, if the conditions are met, notice pay can be requested. However, since the period before retirement is liquidated, notice pay calculation should be made regarding the new period which starts from the new contract. In this case, it would be wrong to calculate for the whole working time within the scope of notice pay.
