### The Right to Claim Annulment of the General Assembly Resolutions of Joint Stock Companies on Capital Increase - When Should Opposition to the Resolution be Made?

**Keywords:** Joint Stock Company, Annulment of the General Assembly Resolution, Turkish Commercial Code (TCC) numbered 6102, Opposition in Advance, Annulment Action, Shareholders, Shareholders’ Dissenting Vote to the Resolution, Personal Liability, Procedural Requirement, Article 445 of the TCC, the Commercial Court of First Instance

The conditions and procedure of annulment of the general assembly resolutions of joint stock companies are regulated in articles 445 and following of the Turkish Commercial Code numbered 6102. Accordingly, the action for annulment of the resolution can be filed in case the resolution violates the law, the resolution is contrary to the provisions of the Articles of Association or the rule of good faith. The annulment action will be filed within three months from the date of the resolution at the Commercial Court of First Instance where the company headquarters is located. Persons who are entitled to file an action for annulment are counted in the law. These persons are:

**Shareholders**
•Who attended the meeting and opposed the resolution and recorded their opposition to the minutes,
•Other shareholders regardless of whether they attend the general assembly or cast dissenting vote or not, by claiming:
- the invitation to the general assembly was not duly made,
- the agenda of the general assembly was not announced as required,
- Persons or their representatives who are not authorized to attend the general assembly attended the general assembly and cast a vote,
- They were not allowed to attend and cast a vote in the general assembly without any justifiable reasons
and these violations are effective in the resolution of the general assembly.

**Board of Directors**,

**Each member of the board of directors if the execution of the resolution will lead to his/her personal responsibilities.**

In practice, it is seen that some of the partners who have had disagreements between them have opposed in advance before the relevant resolution is taken, and filed an action for annulment regarding the resolution.

According to the Court of Cassation, opposing the resolution before the resolution is taken, in other words, opposition in advance, is considered as opposition to the proposal, and in this case, there is no required opposition made. Opposition in advance is not counted as the procedural requirement has been met. As a result of this, in order to file an action for annulment, the case must be dismissed due to the absence of a procedural requirement in terms of the annulment action.
