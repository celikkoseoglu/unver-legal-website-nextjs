# Validity of Employment Agreements Between Joint Stock Company and Board Members and Social Insurance of Board Members

### Validity of Employment Agreements Between Joint Stock Company and Board Members/Senior Managers and Social Insurance of Board Members

**Keywords:** Joint Stock Company, Board Members, Senior Managers, Social Insurance of Joint Stock Company Partners, Agency Contract (Proxy Agreement), Employment Contract, Service Contract, Dependency in Employment Contract, Orders and Instructions, Board of Directors (BoD), Turkish Commercial Code (TCC) numbered 6102, Law Numbered 5510, Insurance in the scope of 4/1-a; 4/1-b

Joint Stock Companies are represented and managed by the board of directors, which is a permanent and mandatory body. Members of the board of directors are considered to be concrete employers. The main problem in terms of labor law is that since the titles of employer and employee cannot be united in the same person, what will be the outcome of the employment contract made with this member if the board member is accepted as an employer? The elements of the employment contract are performing a job, performing the job in return for a wage, and the dependency factor of employment relationship. The dependency factor is the most important factor that separates the employment contract from other contracts that cause debt to work. However, it is essential that Board members act independently. There is no other superior body to give orders and instructions to these members. The fulfillment of the obligations of the board member is already a debt expected from him/her and arising from the TCC, therefore the relationship between the BoD member of the joint stock company and the company cannot be considered as a service / employment relationship. On the other hand, the employment contract is not a contract that establishes an organ relationship between the employee and the employer. In a decision of the Plenary Assembly of the Court of Cassation, it has clearly stated that there is an agency contract between the members of the board of directors and the company; this agreement is not a service contract and the rights and obligations in this relationship are subject to TCC. In a case under the name of an employment contract between the chairman of the board of directors of the joint stock company and the joint stock company and the compensation demand of chairman based on the unjust termination of the employment contract, the 9th Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation ruled that this relationship was based on the agency contract and the commercial court was in charge of the dispute. Compatible to this, the 7th Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation ruled that the lawsuit should be handled within the framework of the TCC, based on the legal nature of an agency contract between the executive directors who are also the chairman of the board and the company.

On the other hand, although the dependencies of senior executives (such as CEO, general manager, finance manager who work under the members of the board of directors) are weak, it is clear that these individuals are bound to the board of directors and have to be accountable. When these persons are elected to the board of directors, if they can act independently, have the authority to represent and bind, or if they are one of the majority shareholders of the company, it is not possible to assume both board membership with a dominant organ relationship and senior management involving an employment contract relationship. However, since the person who is the general manager of the company will be the only person to receive orders and instructions when he/she is elected to the board of directors of the company, the employment contract must be terminated.

As a principal decision of the Plenary Assembly of the Court of Cassation, the legal relationship between the BoD members and the legal entity of the bank is based on a agency contract and the employment contract of the person elected as a member of the board of directors while he was the general manager of the company would be terminated. The 9th Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation ruled that it is necessary to investigate whether the general manager has the title of person or organ; if the general manager is a member of the board of directors without gaining the title of an organ, the employment relationship continues due to his/her duty of general manager, however, if he/she has gained the title of organ who is authorized to represent and bind the company, the employment relationship is over. The chamber tries to characterize the legal relationship when it is in doubt about the existence of a dependency relationship.


**Social Insurance**

It is necessary to consider the insurance status of shareholders of joint stock companies, who are members of the board of directors and who are not, separately. In addition, the date of 01/10/2008 when the Law No. 5510 entered into force is important in terms of determining the insurances of the members of the board of directors of joint stock companies, and the insurance status of the relevant persons should be evaluated separately for before and after this date.

If joint stock company partners are elected as members of the board of directors for the company after 01/10/2008, they are deemed to be insured within the scope of 4/1-b. Insurance within this scope ends with the termination of the director membership of members. On the other hand, in accordance with the protection of the acquired rights of the company partners who were insured under 4/1-a prior to 01/10/2008, their status under 4/1-a will continue until their work is interrupted.

However, if the members of the board of directors who are insured within the scope of 4/1-b as of 01/03/2011 start to work under 4/1-a in another company in which they are not a shareholder, in other words, if these two insurance statuses coincide, 4/1-b status will be terminated and the insurance status will be counted as 4/1-a.

Board members who are not shareholders of a joint stock company are excluded from the mandatory 4/1-b scope of the Law No. 5510. However, we have explained above that the work of these persons cannot be qualified within the scope of the service / employment contract, and the relationship between these persons and the legal entity of the company originates from the agency contract. For this reason, these persons will not be considered as insured within the scope of 4/1-a, but if they undertake another duty within the scope of service / employment contract within the said company, they are able to be insured under 4/1-a.
